🐢 Project Overview
This project contains 5 creative drawing challenges completed using the Python turtle module. Each challenge is designed to practice geometry, randomness, color manipulation, and graphical logic in code.

🎯 What I Learned
How to use the turtle graphics module to draw geometric shapes, lines, and patterns.

How to extract dominant colors from an image using the colorgram library.

How to use loops, dictionaries, and random choices to create dynamic visual effects.

How to interpret and apply information from the official Python documentation.

🧩 Challenges Solved
Drawing a square

Drawing dashed lines

Drawing shapes with increasing number of sides (triangle to decagon)

Creating a random walk using turtle directions and colors

Drawing a Hirst-style dot painting using colors extracted from an image
