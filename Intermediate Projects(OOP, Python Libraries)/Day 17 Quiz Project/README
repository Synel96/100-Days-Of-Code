Day 17 Quiz Project
This project was created as part of the 100 Days of Code challenge. It focuses on building a quiz game using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python.

What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to create classes, methods, and attributes. I focused on structuring the code using OOP, which improved my understanding of organizing related data and functionality in Python.

My Contribution
My primary role in this project was to implement the classes, methods, and attributes for the quiz system and to set up the basic game logic. The logic for displaying questions, handling user input, and managing the score was part of my task.
