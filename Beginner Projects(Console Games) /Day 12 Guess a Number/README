# 🎲 Day 12 - Guess a Number

This is a Python implementation of a simple number-guessing game, created as part of the **100 Days of Code** challenge.

The player must guess a randomly selected number within a given range. The program gives feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and the player has to continue guessing until they find the correct number.

## 🚀 Features

- Random number selection within a specified range
- Feedback on each guess (too high or too low)
- Keeps track of the number of attempts
- Option to play again after guessing the correct number

## 🛠️ Built With

- Python 3

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Using the `random` module
- Conditional logic and user input handling
- Loops and managing game state
