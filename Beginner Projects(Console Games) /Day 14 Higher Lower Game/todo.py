# the game needs to pick two random key from the game_data and save them(importing random module and game_data , create two variable to store the keys )
# we need a function to compare them.(a_option  > b_option? ) 
# game inputs 
# if the player chose false : game over , else if : the right choice should be = a_option .
# need a loop to start again if player choice was right
# game over outputs (win / lose print the correct answers)
# add game scores and printing it to the console each turn
