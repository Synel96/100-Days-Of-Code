# 🔐 Day 8 - Caesar Cipher

A Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm, created for Day 8 of the **100 Days of Code** challenge.

The program allows users to encode or decode messages by shifting each letter by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

## 🚀 Features

- Encode and decode functionality
- Handles wrap-around in the alphabet
- Supports large shift values
- Input validation

## 🛠️ Built With

- Python 3

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- String manipulation
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions and parameter handling
- User interaction via console
