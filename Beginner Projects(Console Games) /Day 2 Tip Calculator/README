# 💰 Day 2 - Tip Calculator

This is a beginner-friendly Python console application made for Day 2 of the **100 Days of Code** challenge.  
It helps users calculate how much tip each person should pay when splitting a bill at a restaurant.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The program:
- Asks the user for the total bill amount
- Asks how many people are splitting the bill
- Asks the tip percentage they'd like to give
- Calculates and displays each person's share including tip

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Getting and converting user input
- Working with floats and integers
- Performing basic math operations in Python
- Using `round()` for clean output

## 🛠️ Built With

- Python 3
